# FX420_StrainMenuCreator
Making this public so I can get some code reviews done.
This project was made to make my life a little easier.
90% of my job as an in house IT person for a dispensary I am updating menus on TVs
And at first this consisted of, making excel files, manually converting them into pictures, 
putting thme on flash drives and walking them out to all of our TVs.

StrainMenuCreator was made because we had a shitty business partner who thought 
"everyone should be able to do every job".
So he wanted me to have an easy way for all of my coworkers to edit menus without excel. 
Because literally not a single one knows excel. Fuck that guy.

This was made to make editing our bulk grams menu easier for everyone.
The other menus in our store has a WIP program similiar to this but its not fleshed out enough
for actual use.

It's under "Exceless Editor", and the code for it is not pretty. Well.. None of this code is pretty. It gets thrown together so I dont actually have to do anything during my day and I look busy.

Code this use a database instead of ini files? Probably. Do I want to migrate over? Nah fam.
